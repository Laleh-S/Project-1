# Snake Game

## Brief
After learning JavaScript for only two weeks, I had to build and design a JavaScript grid game. I decided to chose snake because I used to enjoy playing this game on my sony ericsson phone.

- Render a game in the browser
- Use JavaScript, CSS and HTML
- Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy the game using GitHub pages

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- DOM
- Git

## Wireframe and planning
My planning and wireframing for this project was very limited due to my lack of experience. I was not sure what and how much details I had to add to this. My initial planning for this project was very limited due to my lack of experience. I was so excited about starting a project and I started working on it immediately.

## Key Learnings/Takeaways

The main thing I learned in this project was the importance of prior planning, wireframing and sketching before starting writing codes. I literally threw myself right in the middle of coding without knowing exactly what step to take at each stage. I’ve learned that proper planning prior to coding can have a major impact on the final product. I’ve also learned that good planning would give the coder the ability to foresee the problems they may face along the way.

## Wins
This was my very first project and I only had one week to create this game. In the end I was very happy being able to create and deploy a functioning game and meet all my MVP targets on time.


## Future Improvements
- Working on different levels
- Adding bonus features
- Adding a start button
- Working on the Gameover UI
